# Lamb, because it's docile like a lamb.

A lightweight, and docile, JavaScript (ES5) library to help embracing functional programming.

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/lamb.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lamb) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ascartabelli/lamb/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ascartabelli/lamb) [![Coveralls Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/ascartabelli/lamb/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/ascartabelli/lamb)

## Documentation.

The API documentation is [here](https://ascartabelli.github.io/lamb/).

## Installation and basic usage.

Install it with `npm`:

```bash
npm install lamb
```

Require it in node.js:

```javascript
var _ = require("lamb");
```

It's useful to alias it to have a shorter symbol, like ```_```, as I did above and throughout the documentation: it's cleaner and the
```lamb``` object itself can be used as a placeholder argument in [partial application](https://ascartabelli.github.io/lamb/module-lamb.html#.partial).

In a browser, simply include the version you want from the `dist` folder:

```html
<script src="dist/lamb.js"></script>
```

or

```html
<script src="dist/lamb.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the source map for the minified file in the same folder.

Lamb it's also delivered on a CDN, courtesy of [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com/):

```html
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/lamb/dist/lamb.min.js"></script>
```

The URL above will retrieve the latest version, but you can target a specific version too:

```html
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/lamb@0.26.0/dist/lamb.min.js"></script>
```

You can [try it right now](https://tonicdev.com/npm/lamb) in your browser, too.

## Semantic Versioning.

Lamb uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and please be aware that, as long as the major version is `0`, any
bump in the minor version could involve a breaking change in the API.
You can refer to the [changelog](#changelog) to see if your code is affected.

## Frequently self-asked questions.

- ***Is another JavaScript library really needed?***
  Don't know, really.
  The story here is that I like to write my own code and, time permitting, to even reinvent the wheel: it's part of my learning process.
  This library is only a means for me to gather some utilities I wrote, clean them up a bit and put them together with some new tools to make
  a documented, reusable package.

- ***Are your wheels rounder?***
  Not at all, but I do try my best to add better suspension; and you do realise that you're reading a guy talking to himself, don't you?

- ***Why ECMAScript 5?***
  Because this is simply me tidying up some old code, and will hopefully be my goodbye to ES5 before fully diving into the world of transpilers.

- ***What about ES4 environments?***
  In my make-believe world they don't exist, but in case I can be proven wrong you can load some shims / polyfills before my
  library. There's plenty of those in the [JavaScript Reference on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/),
  and there are many pre-made packages as well [out there](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim/).

- ***Are there plans for the future?***
  Absolutely yes: this isn't a complete work at all, only a first public release.
  I need better documentation and examples for starters, and I also want to add a bunch of other functions and concepts into the mix.

- ***Why "Lamb"?***
  See the main header: because it's docile like a lamb.
